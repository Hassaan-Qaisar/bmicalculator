# BMI Calculator

This repository contains a simple BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator application implemented using React. The application allows users to input their height and weight and calculates their BMI based on the provided values. Additionally, it provides a message indicating the BMI range the user falls into.

## Features

- **Calculate BMI:** Input your height and weight to calculate your BMI.
- **BMI Range Message:** Receive a message indicating which BMI range you fall into.
- **Simple Interface:** Easy-to-use interface for entering height and weight.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React

## Usage

2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Start the development server using `npm start`.
5. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the BMI Calculator application.

## How It Works

- Users input their height (in meters) and weight (in kilograms) into the provided fields.
- Upon submission, the application calculates the BMI using the formula: `BMI = weight / (height * height)`.
- The calculated BMI is then compared to predefined ranges to determine the user's BMI category (e.g., underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese).
- The application displays the calculated BMI along with a message indicating the BMI range the user falls into.
